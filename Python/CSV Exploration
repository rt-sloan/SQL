In this Python source code I am using the pandas library to explore a csv file. I read the basic info about the file and what data types are associated with each file. 

import pandas as pd



#Create a variable that holds the file path to csv files
fpmovies = r'C:\Users\doaal\Desktop\Python\CSV_Files\movies.csv'
fpgames = r'C:\Users\doaal\Desktop\Python\CSV_Files\games.csv'

#Create a function that serves as a template to call a certain csv file
#The 'fp' argument means we have to start our csv filepath variables with the argument
def read_csv_file(fp):
    df = pd.read_csv(fp)
    return df

#read movies and games. Create a variable for each csv you want to read.
dfmovies = read_csv_file(fpmovies)
dfgames = read_csv_file(fpgames)

#Show basic info about the files
print(dfmovies.info())
# print (dfgames.info())

#Show the first 5 rows of the file. Put a number in between the () to specify how many rows you want to see
print(dfmovies.head())
# print(dfgames.head(10))


#Set the options for the maximum number of rows we can view
pd.options.display.max_rows = 61

#Show me how many max rows we can print. 
print('\nMax Rows')
print(pd.options.display.max_rows) 

#Show me hoow many columns are in the csv file.
print("Number of colums", dfmovies.shape[1])

#Show me how many rows are in the csv file. 
print("Number of rows", dfmovies.shape[0])
