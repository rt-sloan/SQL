# SQL
Thank you for visiting the SQL source code repository for Robert Sloan. I wrote most of the queries using Google Big Query Sandbox and utilized datasets from the Google Big Query Public Data. 
I have also utilized some datasets from Kaggle. 
The dialect of SQL that I am using is just basic SQL but I have also included some examples from the PostgreSQL dialect as well. 
I have made it known and clear when I am using PostgreSQL.
