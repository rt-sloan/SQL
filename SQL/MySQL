The following SQL code is written in MySQL


Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
select count(city) - count(distinct city) as difference
from station

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
(select city AS cityname, LENGTH(city)
from station
order by LENGTH(city) asc, cityname asc
Limit 1)
UNION ALL
(select city AS cityname, LENGTH(city)
from station
order by LENGTH(city) desc, cityname desc
Limit 1)

Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT distinct city
FROM station
WHERE city REGEXP '[aeiou]$'
